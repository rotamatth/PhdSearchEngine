Concrete, as we know it today, is one of the most relevant construction materials in terms of carbon footprint, raw materials usage, and structural usage. Huge amounts of GHG are emitted during concrete production, mainly because of the high calcination temperatures needed to produce cement clinker (about 40%) and to decarbonise limestone (about 60%). This, in total, amounts to about 8% of global CO2 emissions. Also, one m³ of concrete requires 2,6 tons of construction minerals, so concrete construction accounts for about 50% of all material extracted for. Climate-neutral concretes and applications are a global research theme of high interest, but none of the current concepts have a full net-zero-carbon impact because they bring partial and mostly fragmented solutions that cannot stand up to the technical demands of AEC."
